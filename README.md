<h2>How-To</h2>
In order to test this code, you'll need to install the Visual Studio Code Extension called "*Code Runner*". Which can be found in the Extension tad on the left section of the software.

Then, if you open the Residential_Controller.js, you have access to the code itself.

Next step to be able to visualize (see bellow for examples) what this javascript does, simply click on the "*Play*" sign (triangle pointing to the right) located at the top of your window.

In the event that you don't see anything, make sure you select the "**OUPUT**" tab.

If everything works, you should see the following items being generated in the console:

<h2>Specifications</h2>


- The JavaScript version has been coded so the Status and Direction of the Elevators update in real time based on if they are set 
to "idle" or "moving".

- The Python version has been coded with the value of each Elevators hard coded for the purpose of this exercise so it can demonstrate that the algorithm and the code are working according to the scenarios.
