To Access The **Go** Version -----> [**CLICK HERE**](https://github.com/CptnWookie/Rocket_Elevators_Controllers/blob/master/Commercial_Controller.go)

<h2>How-To (JS and PY)</h2>
In order to test this C# code, you'll need to install the Microsoft .NET Core from Microsoft website and Visual Studio Code Extension called "*C#*". Which can be found in the Extension tad on the left section of the software.

Then, if you open the Commercial_Controller.cs, you have access to the code itself.

Next step to be able to visualize (see bellow for examples) what this C# does, simply click on the terminal tab located at the top of your window, new terminal and then type down "donet run". 

For the Go file, you simply need to install the Go extension in the Extension Marketplace. Then open a new terminal from the tab at the top of the screen. In the console, type down "go run and the file name"

Enjoy !

<h3>Specifications</h3>

- The JavaScript version has been coded so the Status and Direction of the Elevators update in real time based on if they are set 
to "idle" or "moving" and if their position is equal or not to the floor they need to reach.

- The Python version has been coded with the value of each Elevators hard coded for the purpose of this exercise so it can demonstrate that the algorithm and the code are working according to the scenarios.
